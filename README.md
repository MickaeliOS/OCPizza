# OpenClassrooms-P6-OCPizza

Let's take a break from the coding projects and start focusing about project management.  
In the current project, our focus is on building the functional specifications for OCPizza, a chain of pizza restaurants that requires a system upgrade to meet their evolving needs. 

The key objectives are as follows:

1. Order Management:
   - Optimize the complete order lifecycle, including order receipt, preparation, and final delivery.

2. Real-Time Order Tracking:
   - Implement a system to track orders in real-time, allowing customers and staff to monitor their progress during preparation and delivery.

3. Live Inventory Updates:
   - Provide live updates on available stock to determine which pizzas can be prepared and offered to customers.

4. Website Implementation:
   - Develop a user-friendly website for customers to:
     - Place orders conveniently.
     - Make online payments securely.
     - Modify or cancel orders if they haven't been prepared yet.

5. Pizzaiolo Support:
   - Create a helpful reference tool containing the recipe for each pizza, assisting pizzaiolos in their pizza-making process.
